# ago-clone-items
This code is no longer being maintained or enhanced as this functionality has moved to the [ArcGIS API for Python](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/). You can now access this capability from the [clone_items function](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/apidoc/html/arcgis.gis.toc.html#arcgis.gis.ContentManager.clone_items) on the GIS object's ContentManager. Bug fixes and enhancements will occur in subsequent releases of the ArcGIS API for Python.
